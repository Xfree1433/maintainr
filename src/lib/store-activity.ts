// Report login / key-action activity back to the PF9 store.
//
// The store aggregates these pings onto the customer's Klaviyo profile
// (`last_login_at`, `last_action_at`, `activated_apps`, ...) so lifecycle flows
// can branch on real usage instead of guessing. Contract and rationale live in
// pf9-store/LIFECYCLE_STATUS.md, "App activity ingest".
//
// Two properties this module must keep, because the callers are a sign-in
// callback and the handler for this app's core action:
//
// 1. It never throws. A marketing-telemetry failure must not become a customer
//    unable to sign in or unable to do the thing they pay for. Note that in
//    Node an unhandled promise rejection is fatal to the process, so the
//    returned promise is caught here rather than left to the caller.
// 2. It never blocks. Callers do not await it, and the request carries its own
//    timeout, so a slow or unreachable store costs the response nothing.
//
// It is also inert by default: with ACTIVITY_SECRET unset it returns
// immediately and sends nothing, so this is safe to deploy before the secret
// exists -- which is the order it will actually happen in.
//
// This file is the fleet-wide client, the TypeScript twin of
// app/store_activity.py in the Flask apps. It is identical across the PF9
// Next.js apps apart from PRODUCT below -- fix a bug here and copy it.

// Must match a PRICE_MAP key in pf9-store/store_api.py exactly, or the store
// 400s the ping. Verified against PRICE_MAP on 2026-08-05.
